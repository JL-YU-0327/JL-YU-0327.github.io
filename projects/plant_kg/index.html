        <h2 id="objectives">Objectives</h2>
<p>The primary objectives of the project are to use innovative and competitive approaches to disseminate knowledge about plants, and to seek sponsorship for the non-profit organization. To achieve these objectives, we will cover the following scope:</p>
<ul>
<li>Establish a plant knowledge website based on a knowledge graph to popularize plant knowledge.</li>
<li>Provide high-quality plant knowledge presented using a knowledge graph.</li>
<li>Encourage knowledge acquisition through knowledge tests.</li>
<li>Support charities for every completed knowledge test.</li>
<li>Provide donation windows and advertisements options to raise funds.</li>
<li>Supply a user-friendly interface for staff to view information and adjust the knowledge graph</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="outcomes">Outcomes</h2>
